		  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
		  <div><br>Last Updated: July 9, 2023<br>‍<br>‍<strong>1. Introduction<br><br>‍</strong>We are Tarmi (“<strong>Company</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”). These Terms of Service shall apply to the services that are accessible to you (the “<strong>Services</strong>”) from our mobile application (“<strong>Deeper Talks</strong>”, the “<strong>App</strong>”) as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the &quot;Legal Terms&quot;).<br><br>Each time you access Deeper Talks you are agreeing that you will accept and will be bound by these terms as well as all other applicable laws and regulations relevant to the Services. Please read these terms carefully before accessing and using any of the Services. They form a legal agreement between you and Tarmi, a company registered in Canada.<br><br>Our <a href="https://www.deepertalks.com/privacy-policy" class="link" style="color:black;">Privacy Policy</a> also sets out some very important information that you need to be aware of. The policy describes how we will collect, process, and use your information.<br><br>Only continue to use our Services if you agree with these Terms of Service, and if you acknowledge and understand how we will use the information that you will provide to us.<br><br>We may revise these terms at any time and notify you of the updated version. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page and updating the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this Terms of Service. <br><br>‍<strong>2. Accessing our Services</strong> <br><br>You confirm that you are over the age of 17 and legally able to enter into a binding agreement with us. In any event, our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not use or access our Services.<br><br>You warrant that you are the owner of the device to which you have downloaded our App and accessed the Services, or that you have obtained permission from the owner of that device to download the App and access the Services. You accept responsibility in accordance with these terms for the use of the App on any device, whether that device is owned by you. You also agree that we shall have no liability for the access of any of your information that’s accessible from our App in the event your device is shared, or you otherwise make it accessible to another party.<br><br>‍<strong>3. Our Services</strong> <br><br>Our Services comprise the provision of content in the form of questions, tips, challenges, and quotes, for you or you and your partner. We may change (amend, restrict, or delete) the content making up our Services at any time and we have no obligation to maintain a particular content offering regardless of you or your partners affinity, level of completion, or engagement with that content offering.<strong><br><br>4. Fees and payment</strong> <br><br>Some Services will be free, others will require payment. Some Services may be free for a period, but then require a payment which may be taken automatically by your chosen payment method. We will always make any payment terms clear to you before you sign up for a paid Service. Any such payment terms shall be incorporated into and form part of these Terms of Service. When purchasing services such as Deeper Talks Premium you may make your purchase from an app store provider such as the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. If from an app store provider, in addition to these terms, you will be subject to the terms of the app store provider.<br><br>At our discretion, we may change the price and nature of a paid Service, but if you are already paying for that Service, we will always give you notice should the price change. We accept no responsibility for any losses you may incur by failing to change or cancel a subscription after we have informed you of any changes to pricing of Services.<br><br>Where you have purchased a subscription, your subscription to our paid Service will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you cancel it. If you do not cancel before the end of your current subscription period, you will be charged in advance for the next subscription period. Auto-renewing subscriptions can be modified or cancelled by changing your settings with the appropriate app store provider. If you cancel a subscription you cannot claim a refund for the period remaining until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled.<br><br>If you think that you may be entitled to a refund for Services, contact the app store provider directly as we will be unable to process such refund requests.<br><br>‍<strong>5. Promotional and marketing offers</strong> <br><br>We may offer promotional offers from time to time which may include discounts. These offers may be subject to expiration dates and may only be applicable to selected users of a Service. We reserve the right to end a promotion without notice if at our sole discretion we believe a user is not acting in good faith in relation to the terms of the promotion.<strong><br><br>6.
